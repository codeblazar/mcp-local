# MCP Server Tutorial

This is a simple, educational MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that demonstrates the core concepts in just 2 files.

## What You'll Learn
- How to create an MCP server in Python (24 lines!)
- How to define tools that clients can call
- How MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio for communication
- How to test your MCP server
- Modern MCP patterns (2025 official documentation)

## Files
- **`simple_mcp_server.py`** - The main MCP server (24 lines, modern patterns)
- **`simple_mcp_client.py`** - Test client that shows how to interact with the server
- **`README.md`** - This documentation

## The Server
The server provides one simple tool:
- **`greet`** - Takes a name and returns a friendly greeting

## How to Run (Requires 2 Terminals)

### Terminal 1 - Start the Server:
```bash
cd [your-mcp-folder]
python simple_mcp_server.py
```
- Server starts and waits for connections
- **No output is normal!** The server runs silently
- Leave this terminal running

### Terminal 2 - Test with the Client:
```bash
cd [your-mcp-folder]
python simple_mcp_client.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
ðŸ§ª Testing MCP Server...
âœ… Connecting to server...
âœ… Success! Connected to: hello-server
âœ… Server has tools: {'listChanged': False}
âœ… Found the 'greet' tool: Say hello to someone.
    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet
    Returns:
        A friendly greeting message
âœ… Testing the greet tool...
âœ… Tool response: Hello, Simple Test! Welcome to MCP!
âœ… Testing greet tool with Alice...
âœ… Alice response: Hello, Alice! Welcome to MCP!

ðŸŽ‰ Your MCP server is working correctly!
ðŸ”— It's ready to connect to MCP clients like VS Code
```

**Now the test shows parameter functionality!** It calls the greet tool twice with different names, proving the server correctly processes the `name` parameter.

## How MCP Works (Simplified)

1. **Client connects** to server using JSON-RPC
2. **Server lists its tools** (the `greet` tool)
3. **Client calls the tool** with parameters
4. **Server returns results**

The `simple_mcp_client.py` demonstrates all these steps in action!

## Next Steps

Once your server works:
- Connect it to VS Code
- Add more tools
- Build real applications

## What You Learn

- âœ… **Modern:** Uses 2025 official MCP patterns with FastMCP
- âœ… **Simple:** Just 24 lines for the complete server
- âœ… **Educational:** Shows core MCP concepts clearly
- âœ… **Working:** Actually functional MCP server
- âœ… **Focused:** One clear purpose per file
