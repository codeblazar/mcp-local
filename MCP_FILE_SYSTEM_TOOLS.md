# MCP File System Tools - Building Practical MCP Tools

## Overview
This guide shows you how to extend your simple MCP server with practical file system tools. You'll learn to add real-world functionality that makes your MCP server genuinely useful for development workflows.

## What You'll Build
By the end of this tutorial, your MCP server will have these new tools:
- **`list_files`** - List files and directories with details
- **`read_file_content`** - Read and display file contents  
- **`create_file`** - Create new files with content
- **`search_files`** - Find files by name patterns

## Prerequisites
‚úÖ Complete the basic MCP setup from `VSCODE_MCP_SETUP.md`
‚úÖ Have your `simple_mcp_server.py` working with the `greet` tool
‚úÖ VS Code MCP extension connected and working

## Learning Approach
We'll use a **step-by-step progression**:
1. **Understand the code** - Run standalone Python examples
2. **Add to MCP server** - Integrate one tool at a time
3. **Test each tool** - Verify it works in VS Code Copilot
4. **Build complexity** - Add more sophisticated features

## Step 1: Basic File Listing (Learning Phase)

We'll learn file operations through three progressive examples. Each builds on the previous one, teaching you new concepts step by step.

### 1.1 Run the Basic Example

First, let's understand the simplest approach to listing files:

```bash
# In your C:\mcp directory
python step1_basic_listing.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- Simple file listing using `os.listdir()`
- Basic error handling for missing directories
- Clean, readable output format

**Study the code in `step1_basic_listing.py`:**
- How `os.listdir()` works
- Try/except blocks for error handling
- String formatting for user-friendly output

### 1.2 Understanding the Basic Code

Open `step1_basic_listing.py` and examine:

**Key Python concepts:**
```python
import os  # Built-in module for operating system interface

# Basic file listing
files = os.listdir(directory_path)

# Error handling
try:
    # File operation here
except FileNotFoundError:
    return "Directory not found"
except PermissionError:
    return "Permission denied"
```

**Why this approach:**
- ‚úÖ Simple and easy to understand
- ‚úÖ Uses basic Python built-ins
- ‚úÖ Good error handling foundation
- ‚ùå Limited information (names only)
- ‚ùå No file details or filtering

---

### 1.3 Adding Basic Listing to Your MCP Server

Now let's integrate the basic file listing into your MCP server. We'll do this step-by-step so you understand every part.

**Step A: Backup Your Current Server**
```bash
copy simple_mcp_server.py simple_mcp_server_backup.py
```

**Step B: Add Required Imports**
Open `simple_mcp_server.py` and add this import at the top (after the existing imports):

```python
import os  # Add this line for basic file operations
```

**Step C: Add the Basic Listing Tool**
Add this new tool function after your existing `greet` tool:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def list_files_basic(directory_path: str) -> str:
    """
    List files in a directory (basic version).
    
    Args:
        directory_path: Path to the directory to list
        
    Returns:
        String with file names, one per line
    """
    try:
        files = os.listdir(directory_path)
        result = f"Files in {directory_path}:\n"
        for file in files:
            result += f"  {file}\n"
        return result
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"‚ùå Directory not found: {directory_path}"
        
    except PermissionError:
        return f"‚ùå Permission denied: {directory_path}"
```

**Step D: Test Your Enhanced Server**

1. **Test with the client:**
   ```bash
   python simple_mcp_client.py
   ```
   You should see both `greet` and `list_files_basic` tools available.

2. **Test in VS Code:**
   - Restart VS Code if needed (to refresh the MCP connection)
   - In Copilot Chat, try: "List the files in the current directory using the basic method"

**Step E: Verify It Works**
Your MCP server now has TWO tools:
- ‚úÖ `greet` - Your original greeting tool
- ‚úÖ `list_files_basic` - Your new file listing tool

---

## Step 2: Detailed File Listing (Advancing Skills)

Now let's learn the modern, more powerful approach using `pathlib`.

### 2.1 Run the Detailed Example

```bash
python step2_detailed_listing.py
```

**What's new here:**
- Modern `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.listdir()`
- File details: size, type (file/directory), modification time
- Better formatting with columns
- Option to include/exclude hidden files

### 2.2 Study the Advanced Code

Open `step2_detailed_listing.py` and examine:

**Key improvements:**
```python
from pathlib import Path  # Modern file handling
import datetime           # For formatting timestamps

# Modern path handling
path = Path(directory_path)
if path.exists() and path.is_dir():
    for item in path.iterdir():
        stat = item.stat()  # Get file details
        size = stat.st_size
        is_dir = item.is_dir()
```

**Why this is better:**
- ‚úÖ More file information (size, type, date)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform path handling
- ‚úÖ Better control over what to include
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting
- ‚úÖ Modern Python best practices

### 2.3 Your Challenge: Add Detailed Listing to MCP Server

**Your task:** Following the same pattern as Step 1, add the detailed listing function to your MCP server.

**Hints:**
1. Add the required imports (`from pathlib import Path` and `import datetime`)
2. Copy the `list_files_detailed` function
3. Convert it to an `@mcp.tool()` with proper async signature
4. Test it with both the client and VS Code

**Expected result:** Your MCP server will have THREE tools:
- `greet`
- `list_files_basic` 
- `list_files_detailed`

---

## Step 3: MCP-Ready Listing (Production Quality)

The final step creates a tool optimized for MCP responses.

### 3.1 Run the MCP-Ready Example

```bash
python step3_mcp_ready.py
```

**What makes this "MCP-ready":**
- Clean, user-friendly output with emojis
- Optimized for chat interface display
- Consistent error message format
- No debug print statements
- Ready for production use

### 3.2 Study the Production Code

Open `step3_mcp_ready.py` and notice:

**Professional touches:**
```python
# User-friendly formatting
result = f"üìÅ Directory: {directory_path}\n"
result += f"üìä Found {len(files)} items\n\n"

# Clean emoji-based display
icon = "üìÅ" if file['type'] == 'directory' else "üìÑ"
result += f"{icon} {file['name']}{size_info}\n"

# No print statements - just return values
return result  # Not print(result)
```

### 3.3 Your Final Challenge: Complete the MCP Integration

**Your task:** Add the MCP-ready listing tool to your server.

**Success criteria:**
1. ‚úÖ Add all three file listing tools to your MCP server
2. ‚úÖ All tools work in VS Code Copilot Chat
3. ‚úÖ You understand the progression from basic ‚Üí detailed ‚Üí production
4. ‚úÖ You can test each tool independently

**Expected final result:** Your MCP server will have FOUR tools:
- `greet` (original)
- `list_files_basic` (Step 1)
- `list_files_detailed` (Step 2) 
- `list_files_mcp_ready` (Step 3)

- Verify tool syntax is correct

**Permission errors:**
- Use relative paths when possible
- Test with accessible directories first
- Handle errors gracefully in tool code

**Path issues on Windows:**
- Use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility
- Avoid hardcoded path separators
- Use forward slashes or `Path.joinpath()`
